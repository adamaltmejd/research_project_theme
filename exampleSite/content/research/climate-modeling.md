This project focuses on developing new climate models to better predict long-term weather patterns.

## Objectives

- Improve accuracy of 10-year climate predictions
- Integrate ocean temperature data
- Validate models against historical data

## Methodology

We use machine learning combined with traditional physics-based models to enhance prediction accuracy.

## Expected Outcomes

More reliable climate forecasts for policy makers and urban planners.
